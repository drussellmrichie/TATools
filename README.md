# TATools
This is a set of tools to make a professor or teaching assistant's life easier. Some tools, like the office hours selector and grade emailer, are applicable to TA's in any field. Others, like the logical equivalence and deduction checker or the brain and hebbian learning tool, are more applicable to cognitive science. These are packed up in COGSTools.

**This is a work-in-progress. No guarantees about functionality, or elegance! I do plan to clean this all up, and provide more complete documentation, during or after teaching COGS 2201: Foundations in Cognitive Science at UCONN in spring 2017.**
