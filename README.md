# TATools
This is a set of tools to assist a teaching assistant. Some tools, like the office hours selector and grade emailer, are applicable to TA's in any field. Others, like the logical equivalence and deduction checker or the brain and hebbian learning tool, are more applicable to cognitive science. These are packed up in COGSTools.

**This is a work-in-progress. No guarantees about functionality, or elegance! I do plan to clean this all up during or after teaching COGS 2201: Foundations in Cognitive Science at UCONN this spring.**
